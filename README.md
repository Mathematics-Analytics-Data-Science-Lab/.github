Welcome to the Health Analytics and Multidisciplinary Modelling Lab's GitHub.  

We are situated within the Fields Institute and are part of the Centre for Quantitative Analysis and Modelling (CQAM).

CQAM Labs were established through the generous funding from the Government of Ontario to position the province as an international leader in developing and deploying advanced mathematical methodologies to support the emerging knowledge economy.

As part of our mandate, we collaborate with industry partners to solve complex problems that require computationally efficient algorithms. We use advanced modelling techniques, machine learning models, and AI to devise solutions that lead to innovative products & services and process improvement.  We welcome industrial collaborations.  Please reach us at haml@fields.utoronto.ca to discuss potential engagements.

Our lab also trains highly skilled personnel in the area of health informatics with a focus on modelling, computation, bioinformatics, biostatistics, optimization, data analysis, and experimental design.

We also conduct research in partnership with the National Research Council Canada as part of the NRC-Fields Mathematical Sciences Collaboration Centre.
